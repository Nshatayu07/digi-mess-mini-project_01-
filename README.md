#Introduction
Nowadays, it has become a common practice for students, who stay away from their home for studies or job purpose, to join a mess so that they donâ€™t have to worry for food. And because of that mess business has grown significantly. With so many students, it is difficult for mess operators to manage their data such as attendance and finance. This eventually leads to miscalculation and may lead financial loss to the mess operator or to the customer.

#Objective

To ensure the smooth functioning of the Digital Mess Management system.

To overcome the shortcomings which were experienced by the Mess owner in maintaining the record.

To provide flexibility to the customers in marking attendance, records, payments etc.
